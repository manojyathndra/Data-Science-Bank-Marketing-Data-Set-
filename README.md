# Data-Science-Bank-Marketing-Data-Set-

The goal of this assignment is to understand the ‘power’ of various Machine Learning Classification
algorithms applied into a dataset. By contrasting these very well-diverse and widely used models within
Machine Learning space. The end goal is to find the ‘best’ algorithm to do the job in quest.

Write up Python/R code snippets that will device 6 different classification algorithms on the same
dataset. Namely, apply the following ML models:
1- Logistic Regression (LR)
2- Naive Bayes (NB)
3- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4- Decision Tree (DT)
5- Random Forest (RF)
6- XGBoost Algorithm (XGB)

You should download the following Bank dataset: Bank Marketing Data Set
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The
classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

There are four (4) datasets, you should get only one (1), the ‘bank-additional-full.csv’ with 41,188 records.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00222/
Download the ‘bank-additional.zip’ file and extract the ‘bank-additional-full.csv’ file.
Read details of what the variable/features mean.

Perform various Machine Learning activities in order to complete the following tasks along with their

output. All work should be done and submitted in a single Jupyter Notebook.

1- Prep the data in order to be ready to be fed to ML models.

2- Split the source dataset into training and test datasets at a 70%/30% ratio.

3- Run all algorithms with default values and report their model performance on the following metrics:

- Accuracy

- Precision

- Recall

- F1 Harmonic Mean

4- Generate Classification Report (for each model) including: Confusion Matrices,
